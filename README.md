[Moody Katsuyama - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%A0%E3%83%BC%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E5%8B%9D%E5%B1%B1)




## Motivation

Features

- The conversion features and detailed options I want do not exist in existing tools such as WebToys

HTML to Hiccup

- Option: converting attribute name of camel case into kebab case.
- Option: converting value of style attribute from string to map in order to use in Reagent.

Both GUI and CUI

- I want both interfaces, and I want to go back and forth between them easily.
This would make it easier to share the conversion with others.

Not Desktop App, But internet-less

- A browser application is more convenient, but it should be work without server application
